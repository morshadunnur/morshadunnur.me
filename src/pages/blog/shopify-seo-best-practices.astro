    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">1. Optimize Your Shopify Store Structure</h2>
    
    <p>A well-organized site structure helps both users and search engines navigate your store efficiently:</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 my-4 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Create a logical hierarchy:</strong> Organize your products into categories and subcategories that make sense</li>
      <li><strong>Limit navigation depth:</strong> Keep products within 3 clicks from your homepage</li>
      <li><strong>Use breadcrumbs:</strong> Help users and search engines understand where they are in your site hierarchy</li>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">2. Keyword Research for Shopify Stores</h2>
    
    <p>Effective keyword research is the foundation of any successful SEO strategy:</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 my-4 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Identify product-specific keywords:</strong> Focus on terms that potential customers use when searching for your products</li>
      <li><strong>Target long-tail keywords:</strong> These specific phrases have less competition and higher conversion intent</li>
      <li><strong>Analyze competitor keywords:</strong> See what terms your successful competitors are ranking for</li>
      <li><strong>Consider search intent:</strong> Match keywords to the appropriate stage of the buyer's journey</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="my-8 p-4 bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-primary rounded">
      <p class="font-medium">Pro Tip:</p>
      <p>Use tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or even Google's Keyword Planner to identify high-value keywords with good search volume and manageable competition.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">3. On-Page SEO for Shopify</h2>
    
    <p>Optimize individual pages to improve their search engine visibility:</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 my-4 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Title tags:</strong> Include your primary keyword near the beginning of your title (limit to 60 characters)</li>
      <li><strong>Meta descriptions:</strong> Write compelling descriptions that include relevant keywords (limit to 155 characters)</li>
      <li><strong>Heading tags:</strong> Use H1 for page titles and H2/H3 for subheadings with relevant keywords</li>
      <li><strong>Product descriptions:</strong> Write unique, detailed descriptions that naturally incorporate keywords</li>
      <li><strong>Image optimization:</strong> Use descriptive filenames and alt text for all product images</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">4. Technical SEO for Shopify</h2>
    
    <p>Address technical aspects that impact how search engines crawl and index your store:</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 my-4 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Mobile optimization:</strong> Ensure your store is fully responsive and mobile-friendly</li>

    </ul>
    
    <div class="my-8 p-4 bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-primary rounded">
      <p class="font-medium">Pro Tip:</p>
      <p>Shopify automatically generates a sitemap.xml file for your store. Make sure to submit it to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools for better indexing.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">5. Content Marketing for Shopify SEO</h2>
    
    <p>Create valuable content that attracts and engages your target audience:</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 my-4 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Start a blog:</strong> Publish informative articles related to your products and industry</li>
      <li><strong>Create buying guides:</strong> Help customers make informed purchasing decisions</li>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">6. Link Building for Shopify Stores</h2>
    
    <p>Build high-quality backlinks to improve your store's authority and rankings:</p>

      <li><strong>Reach out to industry blogs:</strong> Offer to write guest posts or provide expert quotes</li>
      <li><strong>Get listed in relevant directories:</strong> Find industry-specific directories where your store should be listed</li>

      <li><strong>Monitor brand mentions:</strong> Find unlinked mentions and ask for them to be converted to links</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">7. Local SEO for Shopify (If Applicable)</h2>
    
    <p>If you have a physical store or serve specific geographic areas, local SEO is essential:</p>

    <div class="my-8 p-4 bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-primary rounded">
      <p class="font-medium">Pro Tip:</p>
      <p>Even if you're primarily an online store, optimizing for local SEO can help you capture nearby customers who prefer to shop locally or want same-day pickup options.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">8. Monitor and Improve Your SEO Performance</h2>
    
    <p>Regularly track your SEO efforts and make data-driven improvements:</p>
